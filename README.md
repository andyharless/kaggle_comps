# Kaggle Competitions

For now, this is just a link to [my Kaggle Competitions page](https://www.kaggle.com/aharless/competitions).

### Summary
I've been in 11 featured competitions. Got silver medals in 8. A solo bronze in 1. One I came within 20 positions of a bronze, after only a week. The remining one I was near the bottom, because a bug showed up in my code at the last minute.  Otherwise I would have gotten silver and [gone on to the second round](https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1/discussion/47257).
