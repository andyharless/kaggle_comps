# Kaggle Competitions

For now, this is just a link to [my Kaggle Competitions page](https://www.kaggle.com/aharless/competitions).

### Summary
I've been in 11 featured competitions. Got silver medals in 8. A solo bronze in 1. One I came within 20 positions of a bronze, after only a week. The remining one I was near the bottom, because, in a last minute change to my code that was supposed to improve the result, I forgot to divide by 10.  (Think of the professor in _Beach Party_, who kept [getting wiped out](https://youtu.be/nkhGmZPJIHY?t=102) because he forgot to carry the two.)  Otherwise I would have gotten silver and [gone on to the second round](https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1/discussion/47257).
