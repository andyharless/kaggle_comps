# Kaggle Competitions

For now, this is mostly just a link to [my Kaggle Competitions page](https://www.kaggle.com/aharless/competitions).

### Summary
I've been in 11 featured competitions. Got silver medals in 8. A solo bronze in 1. One I came within 20 positions of a bronze, after only a week. The remining one I was near the bottom, because, in a last minute change to my code that was supposed to improve the result, I forgot to divide by 10.  (Think of the professor in [_Beach Party_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_Party), who kept [getting wiped out](https://youtu.be/nkhGmZPJIHY?t=102) because he forgot to carry the two.)  Otherwise I would have gotten silver and [gone on to the second round](https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1/discussion/47257).

I added [a little bit](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/andyharless/kaggle_comps/blob/master/my_competitions.ipynb) of statistical analysis of my competition standings.  With 95% confidence, I have at least a 48% chance of finishing in the top 10% (point estimate is an 82% chance) and at least a 23% chance of finishing in the top 2% (point estimate 54%).  And there is only 90% confidence that I have less than a 24% chance of winning a competition.  (Of course the whole analysis relies on the suspect assumption that competitions are independent Bernoulli trials.)
